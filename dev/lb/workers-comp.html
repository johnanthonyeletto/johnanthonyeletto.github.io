          <p>The complicated world of Workers’ Compensation leaves providers with essentially one administrative remedy, the HP-1. Our firm has extensive knowledge of the HP-1 procedures and administrative knowledge to ensure the quickest and best results in the industry. In additional to HP-1 option, we are pioneering a radical and explosive collections strategy to ensure your bills are adequately represented throughout the Worker's Compensation process. Unlike No-Fault – there are significant hurdles and challenges facing a provider trying to obtain payment from the carrier. Lewin &amp; Baglio, LLP is your solution to help you get paid on new and OLD unpaid Workers’ Compensation claims.</p>

          <h2>Arbitration</h2>
          <p>There are two choices offered by the Workers’ Comp Board through the disputed bills process. Your choice will depend upon the carrier’s response or lack of response to your submitted bills.</p>



          <p>Arbitration is used when an insurance carrier has responded to your bills with a timely written objection within 45 days. The HP-1 Form needs to be submitted within 120 days from the time you receive the carrier’s objection. There are two types of arbitration; desk arbitration and panel arbitration.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Desk Arbitration</b> involves a single arbitrator reviewing the parties’ paper submission and issuing a decision. There is no hearing.</li>

            <li><b>Panel Arbitration</b> is conducted at a hearing before an arbitration panel. The parties may appear at the hearing and present arguments. Both parties will receive a Notice of Hearing 30 days prior to the hearing date.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row my-3">
        <div class="col">
          <p>Disputes involving $1,000 or less are resolved by desk arbitration. Providers seeking arbitration in disputes of greater than $1,000 may elect desk arbitration or panel arbitration. The filing fees for desk arbitration are lower than panel arbitration fees to reflect the reduced costs of a single arbitrator.</p>

          <p><b>Administrative Award</b> is used when an insurance carrier has not responded to you bills with a written objection within 45 days. Your HP-1 request must be received within 165 days after your bill to the carrier. The health provider must sign the HP-1 and a copy of the bill originally submitted to the insurance carrier must be attached. An Administrative Award is generated based on the established WCB medical fee schedule. The carrier will have an opportunity to respond to this award. The Board will consider that response, and based on evidence provided will either rescind or uphold the award.</p>

          <p>Lewin &amp; Baglio, LLP is prepared to handle both options and assist you accordingly.</p>

          <h2>Collections</h2>
          <p>Navigating Workers’ Compensation has been and continues to be an area of complete darkness for many providers. Even those providers with a good grasp of the administrative pitfalls ultimately are met with dead ends and brick walls. Through persistence and legal maneuvering our firm has developed a complete and comprehensive system to help providers obtain payment for the services rendered to Workers’ Compensation patients.</p>

          <p>We have dedicated a completely separate and distinct department to address the needs of our clients. Our staff is completely trained in all aspects of Workers' Compensation Law and are able to produce high quality results.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="row my-3">
        <div class="col">


          <p>Our proprietary system attacked the carriers at all angles. Our first approach is to dissect and understand each file and the understanding the basis of why the file is not being paid.  Once the file has been thoroughly scrubbed we then begin the collection procedure which is multifaceted. We work directly with the Workers Compensation Board as well as the directly with the carriers which ultimately lead to a successful collection for your services</p>

          <p>This is where a skilled and seasoned attorney is a necessity.</p>

          <p>One of the best aspects of our services is our ability to obtain payment on files several years old. Through careful consideration and legal maneuvering, we have obtained thousands of dollars for clients on files ten years and older!!! We have a proven track record of our success and can offer you the same results. Give us a call so we can help you get paid today! </p>
